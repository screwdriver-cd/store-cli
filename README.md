## Build cache

To use the `store-cli` tool for caching files and folders in your Screwdriver builds, you can specify `--type=cache` and the `scope` of your cache.

| Scope  | Access |
|---|---|
| pipeline  | Cache accessible to all builds in the same pipeline  |
| event  | Cache accessible to all builds in the same event  |
| job  | Cache accessible to all builds for the same job  |

For example, if you want to cache the `node_modules` folder within the `event` scope, simply run `store-cli set node_modules/ --scope=event --type=cache` and `store-cli get node_modules/ --scope=event --type=cache` (to restore the cache).
